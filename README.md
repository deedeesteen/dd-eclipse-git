The University of Technology (UTECH), Jamaica, is the premiere University in Jamaica. 
One of the outstanding features of UTECH is the efficiency with which students’ Services are 
dealt with. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted the harmonious 
relationship the university’s administrative staff has enjoyed with its students. There are 
now gaps between students’ complaint and queries and their resolution. The university must
now contend with numerous complaints from students. To maintain the efficiency in 
handling student issues for which the university is known, the Students Services Manager 
wants a complaint and query management system that will be able to capture all student
complaints and queries. Upon receipt of a complaint or query, a Student Services Supervisor
will assign the complaint or query to a Student Services Advisor to contact the student to 
rectify the issue remotely. 
You are to build a TCP/IP socket-based Client / Server architecture application that will 
facilitate the above scenario. Your client application must send all requests to the server 
application as only the server application can establish connections to and can 
communicate with the database. The client application must consist of a GUI. The server 
application need not have a GUI. However, it may include graphical components to enhance 
user experience. 
Your system must capture all data about Students, Student Services Supervisors, Student 
Services Advisors, Complaints, and Queries
